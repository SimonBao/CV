I'm a family business manager and a computer software engineering graduate.
Whose currently undertaking an intensive software craftsmanship course at Makers Academy.
Through doing the course, I've obtained several good habits.
I'm currently looking for things or places which or where I can obtain more skills to become a better developer.

## Skills <a name= "skills"></a>

#### Collabrative
I can start on projects with people whom, I've never worked with comfortably either in pairs or groups. Through my time at makers, I was able to develop this skill further as I changed partners/groups regularly.  
#### Flexible leaner
I am a flexible learner, who can learn new programming languages/frameworks in various situations, either solo, pairing or groups. During the course, when I was required to create a product in an unknown language, I was able to tailor my learning process for the product.
 
 #### Adaptable
 I am adaptable and can change working styles depending on project requirements. Throughout the course, I was able to demonstrate this by quickly changing what I was doing and start working on more pressing demands.
